      <p>It's important for Web Developers to understand the basics of manipulating images since rich web applications rely on images to add value to the user interface and user experience (UI/UX).</p>
      <p>FlipImage explores one aspect of image manipulation - image rotation. This app displays a square pane containing a single image presented in a 2x2 matrix. Using a set of up, down, left, and right arrows adjacent to each of the images the user may flip them vertically or horizontally.</p>
      <p>You must only use native HTML, CSS, and Javascript to implement this app. Image packages and libraries are not allowed.</p>
