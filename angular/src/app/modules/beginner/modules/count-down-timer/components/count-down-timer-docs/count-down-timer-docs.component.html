      <p>We all have important events we look forward to in life, birthdays, anniversaries, and holidays to name a few. Wouldn't it be nice to have an app that counts down the months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds to an event? Countdown Timer is just that app!</p>
      <p>The objective of Countdown Timer is to provide a continuously decrementing display of the he months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds to a user entered event.</p>
